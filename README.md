## Why this extension ?

I use to work with Autocad and I save my files to Autocad2013. This software get an option to choose your saving version. Many people are working together with Autocad and share files to work on big projets (electricity, building work, plumbing...). `Autocad get this option`.

I use Sketchup 2020 and Sketchup 2019. I decide to save my files to Sketchup2018 to get maximum compatibility.


## Installation

Dowload extension and install it (2 ways):

- `rbz` files can be installed manually (link) : https://help.sketchup.com/en/extension-warehouse/adding-extensions-sketchup#install-manual
